# Code Templates for Delphi

This is my personal set of **Live Code Templates**, that can be used in a variety of different **Delphi** projects. The intention is _effectively_ use this Delphi feature, and to do that, I decided to create **Code Templates** for the most common pieces of (useful) code that I can remember :smile:.

_Anyone is free to use this repo on any project. Just follow the installation instructions._

## Contents

I still have to convert/prepare a bunch of _snippets_ that I already use, but had not effectively created the **Code Template**. So, this repo should be updated regularly.

There are various categories:

* DUnit Projects
* DataSet Operations
* Type Definitions
* String Operations
* And much more

## Installation

* Clone the repo 
* Create a _symlink_ between the cloned folder and the location where the official Delphi Code Templates are located. 
```
  git clone https://github.com/alefragnani/delphi-code-templates.git
  mklink /D $USER_DOCUMENTS\Embarcadero\XX.X\Code_Templates\Delphi $CURRENT_FOLDER\delphi-code-templates
```

After that, you should see all this Code Templates inside **Delphi**
